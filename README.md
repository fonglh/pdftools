# PDF Tools

This is a collection of scripts to help with digitising paper
statements or bills, which are assumed to arrive monthly.

The scanner used can scan multiple pages into a single PDF, but has no auto
duplex functionality.

As these are currently simple scripts, parameters have to be edited directly
inside the files.
